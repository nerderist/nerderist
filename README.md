Hi! I’m @nerderist!

I’m here to collaborate and build open source solutions that change the world for the better.

I have a blended skillset of creative and analytical that I'm bridging with coding for the first time in my life.

I'd like to collaborate with a diverse range of people and build with a sense of purpose.

Until I get another site up, feel free to reach me through the contact form on www.therealbigpicture.com (my storm chasing site).
